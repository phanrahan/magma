## Mantle Primitives

Magma has built-in operators for combinational logic functions
including logical operators, arithmetic operators, and comparison operators.
It also builds in basic multiplexers.
Finally, registers and memories are defined as primitive circuits.

Additional circuits are provided in the
[Mantle](https://github.com/phanrahan/mantle) library.
These circuits include counters, shift register, and other useful functions.
Finally, the mantle library includes low-level device primitives for different FPGAs,
and efficient vendor-specific implementations of the standard Magma primitives.
