    # We obtain the path to @xmr as follows. (Note that this function only
    # computes the path for the value itself, i.e. the path to the instance in
    # the hierarchy should be computed by the caller.)
    #
    # First, we consider the nested type of the value of which the referred port
    # is a part, as a tree, where array and tuple types result in branches. For
    # example, if the value referred to is `x.y[0].z`, then we build the tree
    # for `x`. The tree construction depends on whether or not we flatten
    # tuples. For example, if we don't flatten tuples, then Tuples are leaves;
    # otherwise, their children are expanded as branches.
    #
    # Next we consider 2 cases:
    # (1) The value referred to is explicitly a node in the constructed tree.
    #     From here, we consider 2 subcases:
    #     (1a) The value referred to is a leaf. In this case, the path is simply
    #          the path to this leaf joined by "_" (since the branches represent
    #          flattening of tuples and arrays).
    #     (1b) Otherwise, we need to consider all leaves which are descendants
    #          of the value referred to. For each such leaf, we compute the path
    #          as in (1a), and return a list of these paths.
    # (2) The value referred to is *not* a node in the constructed tree. This
    #     may happen if the value referred to is a child of a tuple or array
    #     that is not flattened. In this case we need to find the leaf for which
    #     the value referred to is an ancestor. There should be exactly one such
    #     leaf. Then we compute the path as the path to the leaf as computed in
    #     (1a) (i.e. joined with "_"). Then we concatenate the path from this
    #     leaf to the value referred to, joined with ".", since these are not
    #     flattened.
